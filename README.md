# PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

**General Dynamics Information Technology**, Rockville, MD

Web Developer (January 2018 – Present)

I work on the Central Command New Media Initiative Project for the Defense Department. The project’s mission is apart of a larger effort by the U.S. government to disrupt extremist activities across the Middle East, North Africa, and Eastern Europe. I work on a small team that runs five regional websites that focuses on developments that hinder both terrorist activity and support for terrorism in the region. These sites use a custom CMS built in Ruby on Rails. My work has primarily been focused on the client side of these applications.

- Developed and maintained applications using Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, Sass, Zurb Foundation, XSLT, HTML, Git, Jira, and Bitbucket.
- Rewrote all the CSS and Javascript to remove unneeded third party dependencies which has resulted in about a 50% reduction in the JavaScript and 80% of CSS for each site without losing any functionality or feature 
- Helped create a design system to consolidate patterns used across the sites and translated those designs into CSS library to use in each site’s code base.
- Converted websites from desktop only designs to sites that adhered to responsive design principles. 
- Monitored and reported on each web site’s performance weekly using the Elastic Stack (Elastic Search, Kibana, and Logstash), Google Analytics, & Google Search Console.
